# HEB_code_challenge
This is a repository for my HEB code challenge due 11/26

## Requirements
In order to run the "Histogrammar" you must have [python (3.x)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, along with the libraries: "re", and "argparse" (which should be builtins).

## Usage
```
usage: histogrammer.py [-h] [-i [INPUT_FILENAME]] [-o [OUTPUT_FILENAME]]

Generate a histogram based on an imput text document.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i [INPUT_FILENAME], --input_filename [INPUT_FILENAME]
                        The input filename, can be the absolute path if it is not local. If not provided, defaults to input.txt
  -o [OUTPUT_FILENAME], --output_filename [OUTPUT_FILENAME]
                        The output filename, can be the absolute path, if you don't want it to be generated locally, defaults to output.txt if not provided.
```
